<h1> Artist Statement</h1>
<p> 	I am interested in energy, as energy is at the essence of every living being. I am a creator and performer of energy through movement. The energy that I bring to my artistic work is focused, kinetic, limitless, and incapable of being destroyed. When I perform, I use every molecule in my being communicate both to myself, and the audience that which I could not with my words. 
	As a choreographer, the type of art I seek to make challenges the notions of energy through the 
manipulation of time, space, and motion. My current works deal with ideas of bound flow, stillness, 
kinetic energy, and opposition. I explore these ideas often through movement grounded in technique, as 
well as a movement vocabulary that requires absolute focus and harnessing of physical and mental 
energy, ultimately in an attempt to inspire energy in my audience.
	I approach my work with integrity, curiosity, and attention to detail. When I collaborate 
with other artists, I am interested in illuminating their unique energies, which usually involves 
improvising alongside them, or watching them improvise. I arrive at my final projects normally through 
the processes of improvisation, repetition, and notation. Ultimately, I would like for my work to challenge spectators to actively engage in discussion, collaboration, and action.
